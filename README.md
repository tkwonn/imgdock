## What is this

Similar to [imgur](https://imgur.com/), this web application allows users to upload, share, and view images without requiring a user account. It's useful in the following situations:

- Upload images: Users can easily upload images through a simple web interface. 
- Share images with others: After uploading, the service generates a unique URL for each image, which can be shared with others.
- View images: Anyone with the link can view the image directly without needing to log in or create an account.

Supported file types are `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, and `gif`.

## ER Diagram

[screenshot]

- `posts`: Stores metadata for uploaded files (actual files are stored in S3)
- `tags`: Table for managing tags and their descriptions
- `post_tags`: Junction table implementing many-to-many relationship between posts and tags

## Storage Structure

To organize uploaded images efficiently and ensure scalability, the application stores images in an Amazon S3 bucket using a structured folder and naming convention. The object key follows the format:

`<year>/<month>/<unique-string>.<extension>`

For example:   
`2025/01/SharyagI.png`

Time-Based Organization:
- The year/month prefix groups images by their upload date, simplifying management and enabling lifecycle policies (e.g., archiving or deleting old files).

Unique String Generation:
- The `<unique-string>` is generated using a cryptographically secure random ID via PHP's `random_bytes()` function, which sources entropy from `/dev/urandom`.
- It uses a 64-character URL-safe alphabet (0-9, A-Z, a-z, -, _) and is 8 characters long, providing 64‚Å∏ = 281,474,976,710,656 possible combinations.
- This makes collisions extremely unlikely, so the implementation relies solely on a database UNIQUE constraint without additional collision handling.

## Security Measures

### File Size and Upload Limits

To ensure efficient resource usage and prevent abuse, the application enforces specific file size and upload limits. These limits are configured at multiple levels:

1. Frontend Restrictions (Uppy Library)
- The maximum file size for non-animated images (e.g., `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`) is 10MB. 
- For animated images (e.g., `gif`), the limit is 20MB.

2. Backend Restrictions (PHP)
- `upload_max_filesize`: 20 MB (maximum size of a single uploaded file).
- `post_max_size`: 20 MB (maximum size of the entire POST request).
- `memory_limit`: 256 MB (maximum memory allocated to PHP scripts).
- `max_execution_time`: 300 seconds (maximum time a script can run).

3. Web Server Restrictions (Nginx)
- `client_max_body_size`: 20 MB (maximum size of the client request body).
- Rate Limiting:
  - File upload requests are rate-limited to 1 request per second with a burst of 5 requests. 
  - This prevents abuse and ensures fair usage of the service.

### Secure S3 Bucket Policies

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment workflows with the following configurations:

### Continuous Integration

- Dependency caching using Composer to speed up builds
- Code quality checks using PHP CS Fixer

### Continuous Deployment

- Secure AWS Authentication using OpenID Connect (short-lived tokens)
- Minimal IAM permissions to ensure secure cloud role operations
- AWS Systems Manager (SSM) for secure remote command execution (no direct SSH access or security group changes)
